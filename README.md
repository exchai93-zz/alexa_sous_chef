### Technologies used:
* Ruby (2.4.0)
* RSpec (3.6.0)
* Sinatra (2.0.0)
* FatSecret API (0.2.1)
* Amazon Developer
* Amazon Skills Kit (ASK)

### Testing
We used RSpec to test our code. This choice was influenced both by our familiarity with RSpec and by our desire to write fully test-driven code. So as to avoid exceeding the FatSecret API limit, we mocked our API calls.

### Real-world Application
A recent report by the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimated that there are now 8.2 million customers who own an Amazon Echo device, and as customer awareness is increasing RBC Capital Markets predict that Amazon could have 500 million active customers globally by 2020.

As four Makers who enjoy our fair share of cooking, we agreed that the growing number of online recipes and resultant use of electrical devices in the kitchen disrupted our cooking flow. Going back and forth to check the recipe instructions was disruptive to our overall cooking experience. Additionally, the fact that our recipes were no longer in traditional paperbound cookbooks but on our phones or tablets compounded the probability of accidentally splattering ingredients over our devices.

We decided to create the ultimate virtual cooking assistant using Amazon Echo to address this issue. Sous Chef offers over 1,000 recipes with voice-enabled instructions for a hands-free,  smoother and more enjoyable cooking experience.
